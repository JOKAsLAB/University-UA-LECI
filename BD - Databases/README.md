### Welcome to "Databases"

"Databases" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to provide students with knowledge about the fundamental concepts, methods, and techniques in the field of databases, including relational data modeling, conceptual and logical design, SQL (DDL, DML, programming features), concurrency control, security, and the development of data-driven applications.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
