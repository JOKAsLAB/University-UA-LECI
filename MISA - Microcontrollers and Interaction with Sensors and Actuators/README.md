### Welcome to "Microcontrollers and Interaction with Sensors and Actuators"

"Microcontrollers and Interaction with Sensors and Actuators" s a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to provide students with both theoretical and practical foundations for interfacing sensors and actuators with microcontrollers. The course focuses on the development of control software for implementing intelligent systems of low to medium complexity with connectivity features.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
