### Welcome to "Calculus II - C"

"Calculus II - C" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to equip students with knowledge and skills in various topics, including the study of series, Fourier series, and real functions of multiple variables, along with their applications to practical problems and optimization.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
