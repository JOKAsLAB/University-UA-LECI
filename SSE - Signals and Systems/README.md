### Welcome to "Signals and Systems"

"Signals and Systems" (SSE) is an introductory course on electrical circuits and electronics in both analog and digital domains. It is a core course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
