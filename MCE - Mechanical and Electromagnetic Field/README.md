### Welcome to "Mechanics and Electromagnetic Field"

"Mechanics and Electromagnetic Field" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to provide an understanding of mechanical and electrical systems described by similar physical models.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
