Welcome to "Systems Analysis"

"Systems Analysis" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to familiarize students with the disciplines of analysis, modeling, and design of systems in the context of software engineering.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
