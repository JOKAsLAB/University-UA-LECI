### Welcome to "Algorithms and Data Structures"

"Algorithms and Data Structures" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to equip students with fundamental algorithmic strategies involving iteration and recursion, and to enable them to analyze and implement algorithms and data structures with correctness and robustness.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
