### Welcome to "Object-Oriented Programming"

"Object-Oriented Programming" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course introduces students to object-oriented programming (OOP) using the Java language. Topics such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and data structures will be covered to enable students to decompose and build solutions according to OOP principles.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
