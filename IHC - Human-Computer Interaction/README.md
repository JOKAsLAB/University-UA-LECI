### Welcome to "Human-Computer Interaction"

"Human-Computer Interaction" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to provide students with knowledge about the fundamental concepts, methods, and techniques for the design, implementation, and evaluation of interactive computer systems, focusing on user-centered and iterative design.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
