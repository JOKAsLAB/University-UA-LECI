### Welcome to "Data Visualization"

"Data Visualization" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to provide students with the skills and knowledge required to effectively communicate data insights through visual representation.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
