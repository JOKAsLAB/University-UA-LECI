### Welcome to "Calculus I - C"

"Calculus I - C" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to equip students with knowledge and skills in single-variable calculus, including the study of real functions of a single variable, integration, and solving ordinary differential equations. 

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
