### Welcome to "Discrete Mathematics"

"Discrete Mathematics" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course provides training in discrete mathematics to understand combinatorial mathematical models commonly used in computing, telecommunications, processor design, integrated circuit design, cryptography, secure communications, traffic systems, and more.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
