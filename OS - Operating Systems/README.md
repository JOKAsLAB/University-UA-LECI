# Welcome to "Operating Systems"

**"Operating Systems"** is a course in the *Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica* at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course provides students with a deep understanding of operating system concepts, focusing on process management, threading, synchronization, memory management, file systems, and system security.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
