### Welcome to "Introduction to Economics"

"Introduction to Economics" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the domain and scope of economics as a social science.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
