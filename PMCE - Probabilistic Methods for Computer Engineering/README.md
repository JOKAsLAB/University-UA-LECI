# Welcome to "Probabilistic Methods for Computer Engineering"

**"Probabilistic Methods for Computer Engineering"** is a course in the *Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica* at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course focuses on the application of probability and statistics to solve engineering problems. Key topics include random variables, probability distributions, statistical inference, and probabilistic models used in computer science and engineering.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
