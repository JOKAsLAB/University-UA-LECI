### Welcome to "Compilers"

"Compilers" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to provide students with knowledge about the principles, techniques, and tools for building compilers, including lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis, as well as code generation and optimization.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
