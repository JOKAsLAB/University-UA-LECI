### Welcome to "Computer Architecture II"

"Computer Architecture II" is a course in the Licenciatura em Engenharia de Computadores e Inform√°tica at the Universidade de Aveiro. This course aims to deepen students' understanding of the internal structure of microcontrollers and digital computers, focusing on programming and managing hardware resources.

The resources for the classes present in this repository are not authored by me and are located in the respective folder for each class. Nevertheless, they are available here along with some resources for those interested.
